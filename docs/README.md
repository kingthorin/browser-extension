## Chrome Privacy Practices

### Single Purpose

This extension is designed for people testing the security of their own apps. We do not expect people to install it in their main Chrome profile, at least not at this stage. We will be bundling it with ZAP which will then add it to the Chrome instances that it launches - these will be in a temporary profile.

### Permission Justification

#### Tabs Justification

As mentioned above, this is a security extension which we do not expect people to install in their main Chrome profile.
The extension streams a summary of the key events to ZAP - we do this by using event listeners and by polling, e.g. for storage changes. We need to know when the user leaves the current page in order to make a final check for things like local storage changes.

#### Cookies Justification

As a security tool it is essential to see and report what cookies are being set. This is a key feature of this extension.

#### Storage Justification

As a security tool it is essential to see and report what is being put in local storage. This is a key feature of this extension.

#### Host Permission Justification

It's a security tool :) We have no idea which sites a security person will want to test.
